## Status

~~Working on the upcoming 2.0 version, rewriting MSL in Angular2/RxJS.~~
Preview -  http://seedmanc.github.io/my-seiyuu-list/2/#/anime/53,70

The project is abandoned. I planned to use Jikan API, but despite me waiting for extra few years for it to reach maturity, it still doesn't support single person lookups.
What's more, my rival project. seiyuu.moe claims to be using the same API, yet it works for them. This is far too suspicious to ignore, I can't compete with this kind of game.
